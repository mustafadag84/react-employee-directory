# react-employee-directory


## Description:

For this assignment,l created a employee directory with React. This assignment required me to break up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, you will be able to view your entire employee directory at once so that you have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
